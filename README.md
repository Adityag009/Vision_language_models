# Vision Language Models for Textile Design Descriptions

## Overview

This repository explores various **vision-language models** to generate detailed and creative descriptions for textile designs. The primary goal is to leverage the capabilities of these models to interpret visual inputs and produce human-like textual outputs, catering to use cases in the fashion and textile industries.

## Models Explored

1. **Gemini Flask**  
   - A cutting-edge model designed for multimodal tasks. Evaluated for its ability to generate precise and aesthetic-focused descriptions.

2. **OpenAI Vision-Language Model**  
   - Tested for its generalizability and creativity in describing complex textile patterns.

3. **idefics2_8b**  
   - Fine-tuned for visual understanding and text generation. Noted for its contextual depth in fabric analysis.

4. **Gemini Vision**  
   - Specially designed for high-resolution visual comprehension, yielding rich and detailed descriptions.

5. **DeepSeek**  
   - A robust model known for its accurate representation of visual inputs in textual form, ideal for intricate textile designs.

6. **LLaVA (Large Language and Vision Assistant)**  
   - Evaluated for its fine-grained understanding of textures and color schemes.

## Features

- **Textile Design Focus**: Each model was tested specifically on textile-related images to assess its ability to understand textures, patterns, colors, and artistic nuances.  
- **Performance Metrics**: Models were compared based on accuracy, creativity, and relevance of the generated descriptions.  
- **Use Cases**: Suitable for applications in e-commerce, design catalogs, and automated content creation for the textile industry.
